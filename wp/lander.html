      <h3>Your Centralized Planning Dashboard.</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>Track your personal "Financial Health Score"</li>
          <li>Get recommendations tailored for you to optimize your finances</li>

        <p>Like any good coach, we've played the game. We've read the literature. We've opened the accounts. We know where you should be. Benchmarks you should hit. I’ve personally waded through tons of literature and advice. I’ve opened dozens of separate accounts and know what it takes and what to look for. The platform takes what I’ve learned and gives you specific recommendations as to what banks to use, what funds to buy, etc.</p>
