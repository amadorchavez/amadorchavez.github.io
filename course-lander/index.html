  <div class="content">
    <p>Design is the first thing people see.</p>
    <p>Whether we like it or not, first impressions matter. People <i>do</i> judge a book by its covers. You, or your clients, can have the most important content or product ever created, but it will be ignored if it doesn't come in the right package. Isn't that crazy?</p>
    <p>That's why good design is important. It helps you communicate clearly to your target audience. It helps you stand out from all the noise and makes you look more trustworthy. It makes the most important information stand out.</p>
    <p>As a marketer, you already know this. The barrier you face is knowing how to craft a good design - something that is both attractive and easy to understand. </p>
    <p>Most marketers find themselves in one of two boats:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Marketers who know design is important, but they don't think they can ever learn it. They mistakenly believe design is something you're born with - a skill you either have or you don't. They think back to their elementary school art class and cringe at how bad their work looked compared to everyone else's. </li>
        <li>Marketers who have taken steps to learn design on their own. They've read the blogs. They've used DIY tools like Canva or Piktochart. Yet, no matter what they do, they get stuck. Their designs are still missing that 'x factor' that other designs seem to have. They wonder how it is that some people magically seem to know how to put something together that looks amazing.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>A common solution for both types marketers is to outsource their design-related tasks to a dedicated design team - whether in-house or on Upwork. But this can lead to a whole other set of problems. </p>

    <div>
      <h2>How Most Marketers Approach Design</h2>
        <p>Consider your current process. Does it look something like this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Export a Word Document with all of the requirements and content for the design.</li>
            <li>Send the brief and task to an outside design team or in-house designer and impatiently wait for them to get to it.</li>
            <li>Get back an imperfect design that looks 'wrong' - either to you or the client</li>
            <li>Prepare and send feedback to the designer, even though you may not be able articulate exactly what is wrong.</li>
            <li>Rinse and repeat steps 3 and 4 until you get an acceptable design</li>
          </ol>
    </div>

    <p>If this sounds familiar, you realize just how limiting this process is. You can end up <strong>waiting hours</strong> or even <strong>days</strong>, when all you want to do is make a small change. </p>
    <p>Besides that, you are still stuck with the task of giving feedback on the design and approving it. If you knew how to fix the design, you wouldn't even be using the design team in the first place - so why do they expect you to give good feedback.</p>
    <p>The truth is: <strong>Design is a skill that can be learned.</strong></p>
    <p>It's a skill just like riding a bike. And as with any skill, you can struggle to learn it on your own - or you can hire a coach to teach you the secrets behind design and how to avoid the common pitfalls beginners face. </p>

  <h2>Introducing Design for Content Marketers. </h2>
    <p>I've witnessed first-hand the frustrations marketers face with design. That's why I create a premium course on design that will teach you how to create stunning designs <strong>using only PowerPoint.</strong> </p>
    <p>By the end of the course, you will be able to create:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reports</li>
        <li>Whitepapers</li>
        <li>E-Books</li>
        <li>Infographics</li>
        <li>Banners & Other Visuals</li>
        <li>Graphs & Visualizations</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Imagine being able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design an attractive, stunning E-Book in less than an hour</li>
        <li>Being able to show exactly what you want your web or app development team to accomplish by creating a detailed mockup</li>
        <li>Being able to offer insights and feedback on designs that are actually helpful to your coworkers or design team</li>
        <li>Not having to rely on a separate design team with tons of back and forth, scheduling conflicts, and long turnaround times.</li>
        <li>Being able to make adjustments on your own and be a more efficient marketer </li>
      </ul>
    <p>This is completely achievable. I've spent years learning design in my free time and want to help learn those principles. They can change your career, and make you an even more valuable team member.</p>
    <p>This course was designed or all content marketers, even if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You're not a designer. </li>
    	  <li>You don't have Adobe Photoshop </li>
        <li>You've never even opened PowerPoint</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>About The Course</h2>
      <p>Design For Content Marketers give you a proven framework to help you create stunning designs with only a few hours of work. There are frameworks for all types of designs.</p>
      <p>In the first part of the course, we discuss the basic building blocks of visual design. This is critical, but not all that's necessary. </p>
      <p>The second part of the course is where we actually put theory into action, as I teach you how to actually create designs in PowerPoint.</p>
      <p>Throughout the course, are dozens of case studies and design breakdowns. I've gone through great lengths to make this course give you results, regardless of your learning style. That's why each lesson is available in video, text, and audio format.</p>
      <p>Best of all, you won't need to invest in any fancy software. Instead, you can use a tool you probably already have. </p>
    <h2>What's Included</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The one-of-a-kind design course designed specifically for entrepreneurs, freelancers, and employees at digital marketing agencies or startups.</li>
	      <li>Exact Templates for you to get started right away with customizable fonts and colors</li>

	      <li>Bonus 'Website Tweaking' package - designing in the browser</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Who is This Course For</h2>
      <p>I want to be clear: Design for Content Marketers is not like most design courses. We're not trying to teach you the ins and out of popular tools like InDesign or Photoshop. Our goal in not to bore you with theory or the minutia of each tool within a program.</p>
      <p>Most courses focus on theory or walking you through features. Our course helps you put the theory into action. My goal is to help you learn the 20% that gets 80% of results.</p>
      <p>I want to get you from theory to action as fast as possible. We help you take actionable steps to make progress. Please read the following carefully to make sure this program is right for you:
      <p>Its for you if...</p>
        <ul>
    	     <li>You're frustrated of having to turn to a designer for every little tweak or change. </li>
    	     <li>You are focused on providing value to your clients or customers</li>
    	     <li>You want to set a good impression for your clients</li>
    	     <li>You can't communicate why something is 'off' with a design</li>
           <li>You can come up with great content ideas but don't know how to make them look beautiful so that people pay attention. </li>
        </ul>
    <p>The course may not be a good fit for you if:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>You're looking for a magic bullet </li>
      	<li>If you attended design school</li>
      	<li>Premade templates like Canva or Microsoft are all you want. You just care about the basics without learning the principles.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Pricing</h2>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Why PowerPoint? Will this course benefit me if I choose to use another tool?</strong></p>
      <p>A common misconception about design is that you need expensive software to be able to create something great. This couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
      <p>I'm not here to teach you the minutia of Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. I'm here to help you create designs quickly using a commonly available tool. The principles you will learn in this course will carry over to more sophisticated programs when you're ready for them.</p>
      <p>You need to start somewhere. Filmmaker, Robert Rodriguez, didn't make his first movie with a dedicated film crew and multi-million dollar budget. He used what he had on hand. Stop looking for excuses or the 'perfect tool'.</p>
      <p>A million dollar tool in the hand of an amateur is no match with a $100 tool in the hands of a professional. </p>
      <p>An advanced tool will overwhelm a beginner. My philosophy is that you should only upgrade when you can't do something with your current tool. For 90% of marketers, PowerPoint is all you'll need: it has WYSIWYG capability, drag-and-drop functionality, and the ability to experiment effortlessly.
    <p><strong>Will I be able to integrate what I learn with my company's current processes or workflows? For instance, can I generate a PSD or AI file.</strong></p>
    	<p>Sadly, there is no way of doing this natively from PowerPoint. If you truly need to be able to generate these types of files, I would recommend not joining. The benefit to using PowerPoint is the easier learning curve and ability to make faster progress.</p>
    <p><strong>Are you saying I can create entire designs using only PowerPoint?</strong></p>
    	<p>Yes and no. PowerPoint can be used to mockup webpages and apps, but not to create them.</p>
      <p>However it can be used to create entire infographics and E-Books too. Some of the things are going to be done completely in PowerPoint - others like websites and apps are not.</p>
    <p><strong>Does the course ever expire?</strong></p>
    	<p>No, you will have lifetime access to the course.</p>
    <p><strong>What do I need for this course?</strong></p>
    	<p>We want to leave you without excuses. All you need is internet access and a copy of Microsoft PowerPoint</p>
  <h2>Get Started Now</h2>
    <p>The difference between good design and great design is determined by a handful of principles. I can teach you those secrets and the common pitfalls amateurs make. I can save you years of trial and error.</p>
    <p>Design is truly a skill you that will benefit you across your career. The choice is yours. You can continue with the status quo, spend years developing the skill on your own, or get the key insights from someone who has already learned it.</p>
