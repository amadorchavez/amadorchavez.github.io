# Why People Want Your Data

# What Is Privacy Anyways?
* Corruption and Manipulations. Perfect Privacy and Perfect Transparency

# Security & Identifiers
* Security is predicated on showing data to the right person. What does this require? Proving you are the right person? Either by something you know or by personal identifiers whether biological or otherwise (phone numbers).

# The Tech Axiom
* For every good use of technology, there is an equal or greater misuse/negative misuse
* Auto-updates can give you the newest security updates - but they can also introduce new security flaws or backdoors

# We Are Never Free
*  Is perfect privacy possible? No. Not unless you were born in the wild, never went to public school, pay in cash or subsistence farm, never own property, never drive, and avoid planes/cameras/banks/hotels.

# Who Owns & Controls Data?
* Trust and third parties
* Keep it local if you want control

# Or are We? Spam, An Unlikely Hero
* Poison data to prevent mass/automated analysis
* Targeted attacks are still possible
* Patternns and statistics
* Detective Work at Scale

# Practical Advice To Maintaining Security & Privacy. Putting on A Fight
* Not everyone requires the same level of security. Not everyone cares for privacy. What shall we do? Nothing? No. It's find what tier of security you need. On the first level, we have people who want to be protected by malicous hackers but could care less about company and business surveillance. The second tier is for people who want to minimize mass surveillance on their life. The third tier is for people who want to protect themselves from mass surveillance and targeted attacks. This tier must sacrifice a lot. They must modify their behavior. This is for journalists or people in totalitarian countries. For those who want to evade the NSA.
* Prevent data from being sent in the first place (AdBlock, LittleSnitch)
* Poison data [user agent switching, fake location, VPNs, proxy sites]
* Public WiFi: Potential anonymity but also the potential for injected code or Man-In-The-Middle attacks.
* BREAKDOWN: Tactic, How It Works, Trade/Off/Cost, Limitations
* Air Gaps: Mission Impossible happened to an air-gapped system. Targeted attacks are based on reconnaissance - on research - on knowing what we're up against and then breaking in. Are air gaps impervious to break-is? No, but they are pretty much impervious to mass collection/surveillance. The defense to reconnaissance is obfuscation - no records, no idea of what they are up against.
