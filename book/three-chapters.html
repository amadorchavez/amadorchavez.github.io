<p>“I can’t sleep. I haven’t been able to sleep for the past week. He just snores so loud"</p>
<p>"I know it's not his fault. I just don't know what to do. Earplugs don't help."</p>
<p>I laid under my bedsheets, absorbing the words of my college roommate. This was the first time I was hearing about my apparent snoring problem.</p>
<p>He obviously didn't know I was in the room, barely waking up from an afternoon nap. He was saying what he truly thought of me to some of his  closest friends.</p>
<p>I lay there, staying as still as possible, until he finally left the room.</p>
<p>What was I going to do?</p>
<hr>
<p>I stared at my dresser incredulously, anger burning inside my 14-year old body.</p>
<p>All of my things were moved around.</p>
<p>Several things were gone completely.</p>
<p>My mom had did it.</p>
<p>She had "cleaned" my dresser.</p>
<p>She went through all my things, making decisions on what was important to keep and what was OK to throw away, without my input.</p>
<p>She had gone through all of my personal writings and notes.</p>
<p>Maybe she meant well.</p>
<p>Regardless, that was the day I resolved to keep anything important or private in a digital format.</p>
<p>My mom might be able to get into my dresser and desk — but she didn’t know her way around a computer.</p>

<p>These two stories from my past highlight several truths/aspects about privacy. I've had my privacy violated. I've violated other people's privacy.</p>
<p>Some violations are accidental.</p>
<p>Others are purposeful.</p>
<p>What could I learn from these experiences?</p>
<p>I've always been interested in breaking down how the world works and why people do what they do.</p>
<p>This book is my attempt to share my observations about privacy. It's my attempt to answer the big questions — the questions that people rarely ask. Questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do people want privacy?</li>
<li>Why do people violate other people's privacy?</li>
<li>Is privacy good or bad?</li>
<li>Is privacy even possible?</li>
</ul>
<p>As with many things in life, there are no simple answers to these questions.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-privacy">What is Privacy?</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about privacy, we have to define what it is.
I find  the best way to understand privacy is to contrast it with its opposite: <em>transparency</em>.</p>
<p>Transparency is about making things known. It's about exposing the truth, even if it's uncomfortable. Even if it's something you want hidden.  Everything is laid out in the open.</p>
<p>Conversely, privacy is about concealing what you don't want known.</p>


<p>These two concepts, or principles, are and have always been in direct opposition with each other.  The issue of privacy is not a modern problem, but a timeless tradeoff.</p>
<p>Whenever we are talking about privacy, we're making a trade-off between privacy and transparency. Either principle taken to it's extreme can have significant negative consequences.  This can be summed up in the following two axioms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfect Privacy Leads to Corruption</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfect Transparency Leads to Manipulation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the opposing principles fix the opposite's negative consequences from happening, as summed up in these two statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transparency Exposes Corruption</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Privacy Prevents Manipulation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two concepts are both hero and villain. Let's consider at a few examples.</p>
<p>Imagine a woman who goes to talk with her boss about a potential new opportunity.  Or a woman decides to go on a Tinder date. In either situation, it's just the two of them in the room. The woman is sexually assaulted. Because of the privacy of the situation, she is helpless to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Or consider the KKK during the Reconstruction period after the Civil war. Normal-looking people in a community — doctors, lawyers, even church-goers — did horrible, heinous things to African Americans and other people they opposed. They  did things they would likely never do if their true identity was exposed. All of this was enabled by the privacy offered by the masks and hoods they wore.</p>
<p>Or maybe your spouse is acting weird: going out more often, coming home late, withdrawing money from the bank.  But you trust them. You respect their privacy. Well, maybe you shouldn't have because it eventually comes out that they've been having an affair.</p>
<p>If a child has complete privacy with what they do online, they could become engorged in pornography, turn to cybercrime, or become a radicalized terrorist associated with ISIS, the KKK, or whatever terrorist group you hate the most.</p>
<p>Or consider the employer-employee relationship.  Many employers pressure their employees not to discuss pay among themselves. Because pay is kept private, it's possible that discrimination or favoritism could happen. Minorities or women can be paid less, and they wouldn't even know it.</p>
<p>In each of the scenarios above, corruption could have been prevented by transparency. If the woman brought a recording device to the meeting with her boss or date, his crime of sexual harassment would be exposed. If each KKK member could be tied to a real-world identity, they could be held accountable for their crimes. If you monitored your spouse's phone and whereabouts with GPS tracking, you could prevent an affair from happening. If you monitored your child's web actions, you could see when they are headed towards trouble and take corrective action. If employees compared pay amongst themselves, they could find potential discrimination and ensure they are being treated fairly.</p>
<p>Does this mean the solution is complete transparency? Shouldn't we make everything as transparent as possible. Do we need always-on surveillance and monitoring so as to prevent corruption and wrongdoing?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Let's consider the downsides of transparency.</p>
<p>Consider the cheating spouse scenario. The spouse may have been acting weird due to a huge surprise they were planning for you. Sadly, your assumptions ruined the surprise and hurt the trust of your relationship.</p>
<p>Or consider biases in grading. If teachers know whose paper they are grading, they can consciously or unconsciously discriminate against the student. But, if a teacher doesn't know who wrote it, they grade more objectively — based on the content of the writing, rather than reputation of the student.</p>
<p>The biggest downside of transparency, is that it gives people the ability to manipulate. The more you know about someone, the more power you have.</p>
<p>If you run an auto parts store and you know that a woman knows nothing about cars, you can charge her more and she wouldn't know any better. If you know that a person is out-of-state by their license plate, you might be tempted to charge them more. American tourists get charged more all the time in foreign countries because the foreigners know they have money to spend.</p>
<p>If an employer knows you <em>need</em> a job, they can exert pressure on you knowing your helpless to do anything. They can lower your work conditions, assault you, or do any other bad thing knowing you'd be reluctant to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Manipulation often takes the form of taking things out of context. Consider for a moment the Bible. How many interpretations of a Bible passage can there be? How did people use the Bible to argue both for slavery and against slavery? Because they ignore the whole and look for cherrypicked data that supports their viewpoint.</p>
<p>Sadly this happens often outside of Biblical interpretation. Consider how a single snippet of a politician's words or a comedian's routine can be reported by journalists as dangerous and an "attack." If you're the target of someone that knows everything about you, all that person has to do is sift through everything they know until they find a law you broke, or something embarrassing you want hidden.</p>
<p>Even if there is nothing they can find, they may attempt to turn some neutral thing you do often into a bad thing. If you've ever heard the story of Daniel and the lion's den, you know this is what happened. People who hated Daniel tried to find a fault, couldn't, and thus worked to make Daniel's routine of praying a bad thing.</p>
<p>Most of the time, however, there are some sort of actions that someone did that can be criticized. For instance, consider how knowing who a person supports politically means they can be pressured (e.g., manipulated) to abandon or suppress their beliefs. Consider what Mr. Herricks faced when people found out he donated to Donald Trump's campaign.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve had people say, ‘Hey, we were going to use you for business, but we found out you’re a racist. We hope that you burn in hell and your business will go with you." <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/us/politics/trump-donors-joaquin-castro.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/us/politics/trump-donors-joaquin-castro.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though transparency can reveal corruption, complete transparency often leads to more harm than good. Many works of fiction have considered what a world of complete transparency would look like.</p>
<p>Consider George Orwell's, <em>1984</em>, and the concept of "Big Brother" always watching. Complete transparency allows people to be controlled. It allows the powerful to know your  weaknesses — to know that your fear of rats is what will make you abandon love and submit to their desired box.</p>
<p>Consider <em>Minority Report</em> and how the filmmakers envisioned that not just people actions would be transparent, but even their thoughts, that they may have not yet acted on. Consider how Lamar Burgess was able to manipulate the pre-crime system to do his own bidding because he knew what would drive John Anderton to murder. He knew how he could hide his own murder due to the concept of "echoes"</p>
<p>As Danny Witwer once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there's a flaw. It's human. It always is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The flaw of complete transparency is that humans will seek to use it for their own personal gain.</p>
<h2 id="more-than-corruption--manipulation">More Than Corruption &amp; Manipulation</h2>
<p>Of course there are other benefits of privacy than its relationship to corruption and manipulation.</p>
<p>For example, privacy allows for surprise. Apple keeps all of their projects secret. When Steve Jobs picked up a manilla envelope and pulled out the MacBook air, there were audible gasps. Secrecy enabled that. Christopher Nolan's films are also shrouded in privacy, with the intent that it heightens the theatrical experience. On a more universal level, gift giving is a surprise we all partake in for birthdays or holidays that requires privacy.</p>
<p>Privacy also allows for whistleblowing. People are able to reveal bad things about an organization without putting a target on their back by anonymously tipping of journalists.</p>
<p>Privacy allows for conspiracy. Author Ryan Holiday, tells the story of Peter Thiel's secret funding of lawsuits against Gawker, and how privacy is what enabled Thiel to force the gossip site into bankruptcy. Holiday wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy is good. It gets around helplessness of a single person. It balances power. Secrecy enables change and rebellion against an authoritarian or corrupt government. The best case or argument doesn’t always win. You can be right but because you don’t have might, it doesn’t happen. Secrecy is the great power equalizer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your first instinct may be to say that conspiracy is bad, but consider how good things would have not been able to happen without conspiracy enabled by privacy. For example, the American Revolution or underground railroad. Without privacy, Britain could have crushed resistance from the 13 colonies. Without privacy, the underground railroad would have been able to be shut down immediately.</p>
<p>Another benefit of privacy is that it can be a way of expressing empathy. We hold back negative information from people because we don't want to hurt them. This is likely why my college roommate never talked to me about my snoring problem. Privacy is what enables us to follow the adage: "if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything." We often see this use of privacy in the stories we consume. Consider The Dark Knight and how Batman and Gordon hid the truth of Harvey Dent's corruption so that people would not "lose hope."</p>
<h2 id="a-complex-conundrum">A Complex Conundrum</h2>
<p>As you can see,  the tradeoff between privacy and transparency is a  useful starting point for understanding privacy. But it's not the end-all-be-all. There are multiple other benefits of privacy.</p>
<p>If it were at all possible, we would want privacy for ourselves and maybe a few other people, but force others to be transparent with us.</p>
<p>We don't want to be taken advantage of. We want to make sure no one is plotting to hurt or negatively affect us. We want our employers to be transparent with pay structures. We don't want our personal lives visible to our employer.</p>
<p>Sadly, this desire could never be universally applied.  Thus, the question becomes: How should we decide who gets privacy and who has to be transparent? Who decides?</p>
<p>We will be considering these questions in the next chapter, as we  look at the concepts of Gatekeepers and Data Democratization.</p>
<p>But before we get there, it's important to recognize that the relationship between privacy and transparency is not the only thing you need to consider when thinking about privacy. There are also other concepts or principles that affect privacy.</p>
<p>In particular, I have identified three specific concepts that affect privacy: <strong>Gatekeeping</strong>, <strong>Security</strong>, and <strong>Technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As the Venn Diagram below illustrates, these concepts  have purposes beyond privacy. Yet, they each can have profound effects on privacy.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-2-watchful-guardians">Chapter 2: Watchful Guardians</h1>
<blockquote class="introQuote">
<p>“You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”</p>
<p>— Harvey Dent, The Dark Knight</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is truth?</p>
<p>How do we protect it?</p>
<p>In the 16th century, the Roman Catholic church was accused of corrupt practices and doctrines by people like Martin Luther, John Wycliff, and William Tyndale.</p>
<p>The Catholic church was selling indulgences (pardons for sin that could reduce a person's time in 'purgatory'), held that salvation could only come from the church and following their teachings, gave preferential treatment to those with wealth, and conducted child baptisms.</p>
<p>People like Luther and Wycliff challenged these teachings. They held that truth came only from the Bible, not the decisions of man.  They thought that the common person should have access to the Bible, that this access would expose the corruption of the Roman Catholic church and show how they were abusing their authority and distorting the Bible.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic church disagreed and vehemently opposed these individuals. They held that truth and salvation was determined solely by them. They claimed they inherited the authority originally entrusted to Peter by Jesus.  </p>
<p>Thus, seeing themselves as  protectors of truth, the Roman Catholic church banned all English translations of the Bible that “were unauthorized. ”</p>
<p>The Catholic church thought laypeople didn’t “have the depth of understanding” to make sense of scripture and that they would misinterpret it. Alas, there are “things that are too high” for certain people.</p>
<p>Despite the best efforts of the Roman Catholic church to thwart dissent, the Bible was eventually translated and made available to all people. Christians began treating Scripture as the ultimate authority, not the leadership of the Roman Catholic church. Doctrines were clarified, the corruption exposed, and Protestantism began to grow rapidly.</p>
<p>Rather than trust that church leaders were following God, people were able to see and hear the Word of God for themselves, in its entirety.</p>
<p>Information was democratized.</p>
<p>But this brought about it's own set of problems.</p>
<p>Sure, everyone now had access to the Bible. But, without a singular authority, different denominations of Protestantism arose based on differing interpretations of the Bible.</p>
<p>How should a person determine which denomination and Biblical interpretation is correct?</p>
<p>This is the question Joseph Smith allegedly asked himself in the early 1800s. He later claimed that God revealed to him none of the churches were correct. Thus, he eventually formed the LDS church, saying this church was the “restored” church and that all of the other contemporary churches were corrupt and false.  </p>
<p>This claim was completely different from those of  other denominations. While multiple denominations disagreed on certain aspects of the Bible, they believed the shared core beliefs they had were enough for unity and salvation. Only those who denied the core "essential" beliefs were considered false.</p>
<p>However, the LDS church claimed the authority of Jesus was restored to prophets of the LDS church, and thus, they were the final say when it came to doctrine and teachings. They had set their church up as a the new "protector of truth" — essentially they were the new Roman Catholic church, just not corrupt.</p>
<hr>
<p>This history behind several of the different churches still in existence today is a good illustration of the differences between gatekeepers and democratized information.</p>
<p>Gatekeepers are small groups of people that are either given authority, or claim authority through force, in order to ensure a society lives free of corruption. In democracies, gatekeepers are positioned as a group of noble, compassionate, wise and well-meaning individuals. The idea is that by giving full transparency to a handful of good people, who have taken an oath to take care of us,  we can avoid the manipulation that comes from universal transparency.</p>
<p>In essence, we give up certain freedoms and rights, such as privacy, in return for safety. We trust them to exercise wisdom and goodwill. In a perfect world, this allows corruption to be dealt with promptly.  Corrupt individuals are held accountable for their actions. And the people who are living "good" lives get to continue doing so without fear of manipulation.</p>
<p>This concept of gatekeeping is the first concept that overlaps with privacy.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/Users/nifty/Downloads/Book/GateOverlap.png"></p>
<p>Gatekeeping doesn't solely deal with privacy. There are implementations and methods of gatekeeping than don't affect privacy, such as with the example of the Roman Catholic church. Another example would be spam filtering — a form of protection by gatekeepers that doesn't directly affect privacy.</p>
<p>However, more often than not, gatekeepers do demand private information from their constituents to ensure they can do their job of protecting.</p>
<p>In practice this looks like the government needing to able to see where your money goes to ensure you're not supporting terrorists. It looks like your Internet provider being able to intercept your Internet traffic to ensure you're not illegally sharing copyrighted materials. It looks like forcing gun owners to register their weapons, so that we can keep guns away from dangerous people. It looks like allowing the government to know exactly who you are and what sites you visit to ensure youngsters aren't exposed to pornography.</p>
<p>It is important for to consider if gatekeeping can work? Has it ever worked in the past?</p>
<p>Yes, in certain instances.</p>
<p>Back in the early 2000s, in-car GPS units were a thing. It was the early days of the internet and my dad was looking for a good deal on eBay.  He bid on an a particular model and ended up losing. But then someone from eBay reached out to him offering him a GPS unit at a very good price. My dad agreed to the deal. The seller asked him to wire the money using Western Union. He did so.  Lo and behold, he never got that GPS. He was the victim of an early eBay scam. He had no recourse. There was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>A short time after these scams became widespread, eBay became a stricter gatekeeper. They required personal information from both buyers and sellers, mandated a specific payment system, and implemented a buyer-protection program. If anything went wrong with a sale, the other party could contact eBay and get their issue resolved. People could now be held accountable for scams if they used the eBay system.</p>
<p>Or consider the world of olive oil.</p>
<p>It turns out that oil producers were mixing cheaper oils with their olive oil, or in sometimes mislabeling other oils as olive oil due to the high demand for olive oil, and the fact that it's hard for the regular person to test if its genuine. A gatekeeper arose called COOC (California Olive Oil Commission). Their independent agency would test different olive oils on a regular basis. Those that were genuine could carry the COOC label — giving consumers assurance they were buying the real stuff.</p>
<p>However, gatekeeping isn't perfect. For, we don't live in a perfect world.</p>
<h2 id="the-inevitable-corruption-of-gatekeepers">The Inevitable Corruption of Gatekeepers</h2>
<p>Gatekeepers nearly always become corrupt. It's easy to do. And it usually happens due to one reason: the desire for the gatekeepers to protect their power and well-being.</p>
<p>The pursuit of money is one of the common avenues that leads to corruption. Consider, COOC. They could forsake their mission of verifying the genuineness  of Olive Oil, and instead allow oil producers to pay them to use their seal. This is what happened in the case of the browser plugin AdBlock Plus. Originally designed as a way to block ads, AdBlock Plus was eventually acquired and adjusted so that it didn't block "good" ads by default. Ads could be classified as "good" if the ad publisher paid a fee to have AdBlock review them.</p>
<p>The desire to keep beneficial relationships is another cause for why gatekeepers forsake their mission. This is most often seen with journalists, who agree to not report or dig out negative information about a subject, in exchange for continued or exclusive access to news about a subject.</p>
<p>Gatekeepers have a deep hate and resentment towards whistleblowers. People who try to expose wrongdoing of the gatekeeper. Consider Ed Snowden who revealed some of the illegal practices being used by the government under the guise of "safety." The government often uses the vast array of information that would theoretically only be used to fight corruption, to instead target and discredit those that point out corruption in the government. As Snowden said in his interview with Joe Rogan, the government never attacks the claims, just the people.</p>
<h2 id="is-transparency-a-solution-to-the-gatekeeper-system">Is Transparency a Solution to the Gatekeeper System?</h2>
<p>Could we improve the system of Gatekeepers and prevent corruption by requiring them to be transparent with us about what they do?</p>
<p>Some people have posited just this — that if we have just the right amount of oversight, as well as good checks and balances, we can prevent corruption of gatekeepers. Gatekeepers need to be honest with the people they are guarding — it's the people's right.</p>
<p>Sadly, transparency is not enough to solve gatekeeping's biggest flaws. There are two reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, the more transparent a gatekeeper is, the easier it is for corrupt people to manipulate the gatekeeper and bypass their controls.</p>
<p>For example, Google doesn't share details about their ranking algorithm, because if they do, spammers could manipulate their systems to ensure they ranked first. Google goes through great lengths to hide how both Google and YouTube work.</p>
<p>Similarly, the government argues that if they reveal their investigative methods, then criminals will be able to outsmart law enforcement and get away with their crimes. That's why the government would rather let a criminal go free than discuss the details of "Stingray" devices.  If the identity of all undercover policemen was made transparent, then criminals would know not to do anything bad in their presence.</p>
<p>The second reason transparency doesn't work is due to one specific way gatekeepers strive to keep their power — by bowing to the majority-will of constituents.</p>
<p>In other words, if the majority of people believe x is corrupt, then the gatekeeper better agree — or risk being replaced (e.g., losing power). This is dangerous and highlights one of the unfortunate truths of the world we live in: society's definition of corruption changes over time.</p>
<p>What is considered wrong today may have been considered right 100 years ago, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Slavery was once considered good and runaways were considered corrupt lawbreakers. It's the same with segregation, woman's rights, homosexuality, or countless other revised laws.</p>
<p>Thus, the most insidious threat of gatekeepers is that a moral person today can be considered a corrupt person tomorrow. And all of that data you have willingly given to the gatekeeper today will eventually be used against you to hold you accountable tomorrow. It is for this reason that the statement "if you do nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about" is inaccurate.</p>
<p>With gatekeepers, the grave dilemma we face is "who gets to decide what corruption is?"</p>
<p>The definition of corruption varies from gatekeeper to gatekeeper.</p>
<ul>
<li>China believes that being Christian or Muslim is corrupt, because people's loyalty will no longer be to the state, but to God.</li>
<li>Hitler held that being Jewish was corruption.</li>
<li>Uber defined corruption as any person or business who got in their way. They used "God Mode" to protect themselves from government intervention and regulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the gatekeeper system, we see that some will benefit, such as those in the majority or those who are actual gatekeepers. Others, like whistleblowers or minorities, will lose. Even gatekeepers who have the noblest of intentions can find themselves the enemy of those they once claimed to protect. Gatekeepers can be transparent about these shifts, but it won't undo the damage.</p>
<p>In democracies, there is competition to decide who will become gatekeeper. Depending on who has control determines who gets privacy respected and who gets shamed and manipulated.</p>
<p>As a recent example in the US, consider those on the Left who have exposed the names of those who have donated to Donald Trump's campaign. Those on the Right see it as an egregious violation of privacy. Those on the Left don't see it as an issue at all — because we need to hold these donors accountable for "hurting democracy."</p>
<p>On the flip side, when those on the Right expose the names of those who have gotten an abortion, or or who are illegal immigrants, the Left angrily decries at as a violation of privacy. The Right sees it as as a way of holding people "morally accountable."</p>
<p>No matter your political or philosophical alignment, you likely believe that the threat of corruption exists. You think some groups or subsets of people don't deserve privacy or freedom. You think they would misuse such freedom, that they can't be trusted. Unfortunately, people think the same thing about you.</p>
<h2 id="the-danger-of-freedom">The Danger of Freedom</h2>
<p>If gatekeepers inevitably become corrupt, should we abandon them completely?</p>
<p>Shouldn't we give power to individuals instead of protectors? Won't this maximize privacy and freewill? Sure, corruption could still happen. Bu it would be at a much smaller scale than if an all-knowing elite were to become corrupt.</p>
<p>This approach of data democratization has often been touted as a better option than the gatekeeper system. No entity is entitled to information about individuals. Instead, individuals decide what information they wish to share for the public good. Every individual is treated the same, and their voice is given equal weight.</p>
<p>Data democratization was one of the key ideas fostered by the Internet. Instead of businesses or small groups of individuals deciding what can be seen, everyone individual person had the power to share information about whatever they wanted, while keeping privacy about whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>Consider Amazon. Instead of relying on reviews from publications like Consumer Reviews, who could be vulnerable to the influence of the powerful, any average person could look at reviews left by people just like them, for any product. It was a win for consumers.</p>
<p>Sellers on Amazon also benefitted. They didn't have to go through the hassle of getting a business license or following several regulations.</p>
<p>For a while, this system worked beautifully. But eventually, enterprising people took advantage of the fact that there is no authority or accountability. People left fake reviews in exchange for money or free products. Sellers sold counterfeit items. When both fake reviews and legitimate reviews are given equal weight, people get hurt. It's the same with fake products and legitimate products.</p>
<p>The biggest weaknesses of data democratization are lack of accountability and misinformation. If someone says or does something wrong, you can't hold them personally responsible.</p>
<p>If everyone is treated equally, experts cannot impose their will. Is that a good thing. What about vaccinations? If people buy into the lies of anti-vaxxers, people are at risk of dying. Some say people can't correctly decide who to trust, so the elite should make the choice for them by gatekeeping and choosing who can speak and who can't.</p>
<p>According to Edward Snowden, the government believes they know better than citizens. They believe citizens will make the wrong tradeoff. Thus, citizens don't have a seat at government because of the "sensitive" stuff they are incapable of understanding.</p>
<p>While gatekeeping is a crisis of people falling victim to the allure of power, data democracy is a crisis of epistemology and helplessness.</p>
<p>What can we know? There is so much conflicting information out there.</p>
<p>How can we protect ourselves? There is no authority to help us.</p>
<p>Creators of platforms like Twitter or Amazon were sold as being objective; impervious to corruption. But as long as humans are an input, there can be no objectivity.</p>
<h2 id="the-never-ending-cycle">The Never-Ending Cycle</h2>
<p>Gatekeepers will rise and fall. Data democratization will wax and wane. It's a natural cycle we still see to this day.</p>
<p>When people abuse democratized systems, people call for a protector. We're seeing this in 2019 with calls for Facebook to be regulated. We see it with calls for Twitter to ban "hate speech". For this regulation to occur, Facebook and Twitter must be able to identify actual people — otherwise people could just sign up for a new account with a different email address. The new regulations may hurt people. The government could say that Twitter needs to ban whistleblowers, thus eliminating a channel for exposing corruption.</p>
<p>If and when such corruption happens, people will clamor for a more free system. Edward Snowden described this cycle as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kings of absolute power ==&gt; Revolution + Limits ==&gt; Kings of absolute power</p>

<p>The root motivation for calling for either a gatekeeper or data democratization is the same: corruption — and that corruption is caused by the same thing privacy.</p>
<p>Should individuals have privacy and ability to do things without being required to disclose information or submit to an authority. Or should groups of moral people have privacy as they strive to make a perfect world.</p>
<p>As you can see, answering the question on who should have privacy is difficult. In theory, it's easy. Only good people should have privacy.</p>
<p>But in the real world, is there such a thing as a good person? If humans were incorruptible, gatekeepers would work. As it is, we often bounce from one extreme to the next.</p>

<p>The secret meeting was just about to begin.</p>
<p>The leader rose up to speak.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Everyone tensed up.</p>
<p>The knock continued in a very particular pattern.</p>
<p>Everyone relaxed.</p>
<p>The person at the door knew the secret knock. They were safe to be let in.</p>
<p>Nobody in the room had met this particular person before. But he said he knew one of their members from a different city, who told him about the group and their goal.</p>
<p>The meeting continued.</p>
<p>Little did everyone know that the new person was actually a spy for the enemy.</p>
<p>Everyone in the room would eventually  be arrested and hanged.</p>

<p>Good security is important for keeping information and secrets safe. As the fictional story above shows, poor security equals exposure.</p>
<p>But it's important to realize that security is more than privacy. Remember this is a concept that overlaps with privacy.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/Users/nifty/Downloads/Book/securityOverlap.png"></p>
<p>In academic circles security is often defined using the <strong>CIA</strong> acronym: <em>Confidentiality</em>, <em>Integrity</em>, and <em>Access.</em></p>
<p>The Confidentiality aspect of the CIA triad is what relates directly to privacy.</p>
<p>The other two aspects are important, but don't impact privacy. For example, a hacker gaining access to the electrical grid doesn't hurt privacy, but is still dangerous in the sense that they can cut power to millions of homes.</p>
<p>Security affects privacy in two ways. First, it can <em>enable</em> privacy through the use of encryption or other means of limiting access to information.</p>
<p>Secondly, it can <em>hurt</em> privacy by linking specific people to specific information. This is usually due to prioritization of the <em>Access</em> aspect in the CIA triad.</p>
<p>Security methods can be either knowledge-based or identity-based. Identity-based methods have the highest potential for hurting your privacy.</p>
<p>Knowledge-based methods involve something you know, such as a username and password, or a secret knock. They can't be tied to any singular person, because theoretically anyone could know the information.</p>
<p>Identity-based methods go beyond knowledge and require an actual link to you as a person.</p>
<p>Security is predicated on showing data to the right person. What does this require? Proving you are the right person? Either by something you know or by personal identifiers. With knowledge-based security, you have plausible deniability. No one can prove you know something unless you admit to it.</p>
<p>Being able to connect an actual person to an account can be devastating to privacy in a number of ways.</p>
<p>First, if the system is breached, every action and data point stolen is tied to you as a person. Think if somebody hacked into Google and stole all of your emails.</p>
<p>Second, even if there is no breach, the provider of the system knows exactly what you did. Government institutions require that any time data is accessed, there is a log of who made the data request. Google likely has the ability to link a specific email account to a specific person, meaning they know everything that person did do. All it takes is a rogue employee, valid government request, or the promise of lots of money to have all data uniquely tied to the person given out. A full list of everything that individual has ever done, without any deniability.</p>
<p>In the past decade, we have seen a trend of security being tied to people, rather than credentials.  Rather than relying on things like usernames and passwords, we are now tying access to our phones, devices, biometrics, or even the way we type.</p>
<p>Is it because people want to strip us of our privacy? Most often, this is not the case. Knowledge-based security has several weaknesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you lose the knowledge, you lose the data forever. It can never be regained.</li>
<li>If the knowledge is stolen, you can't block whoever stole the knowledge from accessing the data, as illustrated with the story of the spy and the secret door-knock.</li>
</ul>
<p>Identity-based security addresses these weaknesses, but introduces the privacy weaknesses described earlier. Connecting a person to an account, rather than a mask opens the door for privacy intrusions.</p>
<p>That's why it's important to be conscious of the type of security methods you use. If you don't want something tied specifically to you, you need to seek out knowledge-based security methods.</p>
<p>Interestingly, gatekeepers often try to force identity-based security. For instance, the UK wants to be able to prevent minors from viewing pornographic material. The only way to do that is to tie each internet user to a real-world ID. While it achieves the goal of preventing minors from accessing it (who would just lie under a knowledge-based method), it also introduces the risk of having any individual person's internet actions revealed.</p>
