# Requirements and Trade-offs

There are things in life we can't control.

There are compromises that have to be made.

And that's when tough decisions have to be made. When it comes to design, there are many 'shareholders' : the viewer, the company, the medium. You may have limited space for your design. Or maybe your boss wants you to include a very specific set of information. If you're designing for a screen, you have to be extra wary of colors as well as the exact display configurations your users may be using. You need to design for the medium. You need to show empathy for your audience. A print design is more controllable because the medium is very consistent.

**Design is about trade-offs.**
What is most important?

You canâ€™t make everything important. There need to be compromises you make. You may emphasize consistency at the expense of contrast. In video editing I could either use the best performance or focus on nice cuts.


## Limitations Generate Creativity
A common tactic used by artists to force creativity is to create limitations. What happens if a film can only be shot in black and white. Each additional variable requires attention. Removing variables lets you give more attention to the remaing variables.
