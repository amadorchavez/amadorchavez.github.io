# PowerPoint: A Powerful Design Tool
Now that you know the principles and elements of design, it's time to start applying them. We'll start with PowerPoint.

PowerPoint is really an effective and efficient design tool. It's powerful and easy. My whole goal is to make design more accessible to people.

The impact of snobbery and tribes. "Microsoft sucks." "Real designers use photoshop." "There's a reason PSDs are all over the place"


Photoshop
* Layers
* Changing Font Size requires multiple clicks
* Deleting is not straightforward
* Making changes is not straightforward

HTML/CSS
* Positioning is hard
* All styling is done with lines of code.
* You can't start with the footer. You have to have everything planned out beforehand. In fact, most websites are designed in Photoshop first before they are coded in an HTML format.
* Very Structured and hierarchical


You'll spend half the time just learning the tool. Our goal is to focus less on the tool and more on the creating. When you're ready and outgrow PowerPoint, you can move to the more fancy tools.

PowerPoint is simple. It's an extension of paper and pen. You have complete control and freedom to start where you want. It's even better. You can undo things. You can make rapid adjustments.

The WYSISWG environment takes the best aspects of paper and the best aspects of digital to give you complete freedom while eliminating risk. CSS and Photoshop are not nearly as forgiving.
